            The Ocean is vast.
            Colossal.
            Enormous.
            Both in it's expanse and depth.

            We all know that.

            But how much do we understand, really?

            Only 26% of the seafloor has been mapped.
            Only 5% has been physically explored.

            There is life beyond the land.
            There is life underneath.
            Life unknown, undocumented, undiscovered.
            There are aliens beneath our feet.
            Guess we were too busy looking at the wrong kind of blue.
