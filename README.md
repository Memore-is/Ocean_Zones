# Ocean Zones

We, humans, have always been curious about life.
And that curiosity, the search for life beyond our knowledge, is what took us to space. 

Yet most of the ocean remains hidden.
Unexplored, unmapped.
Holding the very life form we have been searching for.
Right on Earth. In this planet we call our home.
