# Ocean Zones

We, humans, have always been curious about life. 

And that curiosity, the search for life beyond our knowledge, is what took us to space.  


Yet most of the ocean remains hidden.

Unexplored, unmapped.

Holding the very life form we have been searching for.

Right on Earth. In this planet we call our home.



Ocean zones is a webpage that explores the pelagic zones or the five major water columns of the ocean.
The project was made for athena awards, and is my first try in web development. Built using HTML and CSS, and while I wanted to use Javascript, I failed miserably (also short on time). I gained a basic idea of the web development process through this project. I hope to come back to update it in the future.
